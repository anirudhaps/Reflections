**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
  repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area lies in between working directory and repository. When we
  have to commit some changes lying in one or more files. We have to do git add
  of those files. This will add those files into the staging area. Now the 
  staging area contains a set of files that together conprise a logical change.
  This logical set of files will be commited together next.
