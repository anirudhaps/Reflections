**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would like to use a remote repository if I need to share my changes to the public and
  get suggestions. Or If I want to allow others to collaborate with me on project, I will
  put that project on a remote repository and will make it accessible to all collaborators.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  We might want to always pull changes manually because it gives us control to decide 
  whether or not to include changes present in remote repository into our local repository.
  We may we working on our own version and we may not like to include changes that are
  dynamically getting checked into the remote repository by other collaborators. As and 
  when needed, we can manually pull the changes from remote repository.

**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
  instead of another?

  Forks are used to clone a repository within the github. That is, to clone someone's 
  repository into your account. Clone is used to copy a repository from github to your
  local environment. Branches are created on top of an existing commit. After creating
  a new branch, if we push its changes to github remote repository, then only it will 
  be available there. Branches are created when we want to work on some additional 
  functionality parallelly with our main functionality.
