**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would like to use a remote repository if I need to share my changes to the public and
  get suggestions. Or If I want to allow others to collaborate with me on project, I will
  put that project on a remote repository and will make it accessible to all collaborators.
