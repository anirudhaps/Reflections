**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would like to use a remote repository if I need to share my changes to the public and
  get suggestions. Or If I want to allow others to collaborate with me on project, I will
  put that project on a remote repository and will make it accessible to all collaborators.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  We might want to always pull changes manually because it gives us control to decide 
  whether or not to include changes present in remote repository into our local repository.
  We may we working on our own version and we may not like to include changes that are
  dynamically getting checked into the remote repository by other collaborators. As and 
  when needed, we can manually pull the changes from remote repository.
